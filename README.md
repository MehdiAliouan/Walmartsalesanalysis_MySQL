Inserting and organizing data to analyze various aspects such as time of day, day of the week, and month.
Performing SQL queries to extract insights on product performance, revenue, customer types, payment methods, and more.

Action:

Database Creation: Created a database and table structure to store detailed sales data, including invoice IDs, branch information, product details, and transaction amounts.
Data Insertion: Inserted sales data into the table and added columns for derived metrics such as time of day, day name, and month name.
SQL Queries: Executed multiple SQL queries to analyze different aspects of the sales data, such as identifying the most common payment methods, the highest revenue-generating months, and customer behavior patterns.

Result: 

The analysis provided valuable insights, such as identifying the most common payment methods, the best-selling product lines, and the cities with the highest revenue. It also revealed customer behavior trends, such as the most common customer types and gender distribution across branches.

Reflection: The project successfully demonstrated the use of MySQL for data analysis, providing a clear understanding of Walmart's sales data. Future improvements could include integrating more advanced analytics and visualizations to enhance the insights gained.
